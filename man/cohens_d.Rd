\arguments{
\item{x}{A formula, a numeric vector, or a character name of one in \code{data}.}

\item{y}{A numeric vector, a grouping (character / factor) vector, a or a
character  name of one in \code{data}. Ignored if \code{x} is a formula.}

\item{data}{An optional data frame containing the variables.}

\item{pooled_sd}{If \code{TRUE} (default), a \code{\link[=sd_pooled]{sd_pooled()}} is used (assuming equal
variance). Else the mean SD from both groups is used instead.}

\item{mu}{a number indicating the true value of the mean (or
    difference in means if you are performing a two sample test).}

\item{paired}{If \code{TRUE}, the values of \code{x} and \code{y} are considered as paired.
This produces an effect size that is equivalent to the one-sample effect
size on \code{x - y}.}

\item{ci}{Confidence Interval (CI) level}

\item{verbose}{Toggle warnings and messages on or off.}

\item{...}{Arguments passed to or from other methods.}

\item{iterations, correction}{deprecated.}
}
\value{
A data frame with the effect size ( \code{Cohens_d}, \code{Hedges_g},
\code{Glass_delta}) and their CIs (\code{CI_low} and \code{CI_high}).
}
\description{
Compute effect size indices for standardized differences: Cohen's \emph{d},
Hedges' \emph{g} and Glass’s \emph{delta}. (This function returns the \strong{population}
estimate.)
\cr\cr
Both Cohen's \emph{d} and Hedges' \emph{g} are the estimated the standardized
difference between the means of two populations. Hedges' \emph{g} provides a bias
correction (using the exact method) to Cohen's \emph{d} for small sample sizes.
For sample sizes > 20, the results for both statistics are roughly
equivalent. Glass’s \emph{delta} is appropriate when the standard deviations are
significantly different between the populations, as it uses only the \emph{second}
group's standard deviation.
}
\details{
Set \code{pooled_sd = FALSE} for effect sizes that are to accompany a Welch's
\emph{t}-test (Delacre et al, 2021).
}
\note{
The indices here give the population estimated standardized difference.
Some statistical packages give the sample estimate instead (without
applying Bessel's correction).
}
\section{Confidence Intervals}{

Unless stated otherwise, confidence intervals are estimated using the
Noncentrality parameter method; These methods searches for a the best
non-central parameters (\code{ncp}s) of the noncentral t-, F- or Chi-squared
distribution for the desired tail-probabilities, and then convert these
\code{ncp}s to the corresponding effect sizes. (See full \link{effectsize-CIs} for
more.)
}

\section{CI Contains Zero}{

Keep in mind that \code{ncp} confidence intervals are inverted significance tests,
and only inform us about which values are not significantly different than
our sample estimate. (They do \emph{not} inform us about which values are
plausible, likely or compatible with our data.) Thus, when CIs contain the
value 0, this should \emph{not} be taken to mean that a null effect size is
supported by the data; Instead this merely reflects a non-significant test
statistic - i.e. the \emph{p}-value is greater than alpha (Morey et al., 2016).
\cr\cr
For positive only effect sizes (Eta squared, Cramer's V, etc.; Effect sizes
associated with Chi-squared and F distributions), this applies also to cases
where the lower bound of the CI is equal to 0. Even more care should be taken
when the \emph{upper} bound is equal to 0 - this occurs when \emph{p}-value is greater
than 1-alpha/2 making, the upper bound cannot be estimated, and the upper
bound is arbitrarily set to 0 (Steiger, 2004). For example:\if{html}{\out{<div class="r">}}\preformatted{eta_squared(aov(mpg ~ factor(gear) + factor(cyl), mtcars[1:7, ]))
}\if{html}{\out{</div>}}\preformatted{## # Effect Size for ANOVA (Type I)
## 
## Parameter    | Eta2 (partial) |       90\% CI
## --------------------------------------------
## factor(gear) |           0.58 | [0.00, 0.84]
## factor(cyl)  |           0.46 | [0.00, 0.78]
