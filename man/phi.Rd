\usage{
phi(x, y = NULL, ci = 0.95, adjust = FALSE, CI, ...)

cohens_w(x, y = NULL, ci = 0.95, adjust = FALSE, CI, ...)

cramers_v(x, y = NULL, ci = 0.95, adjust = FALSE, CI, ...)

}
\arguments{
\item{x}{a numeric vector or matrix. \code{x} and \code{y} can also
    both be factors.}

\item{y}{a numeric vector; ignored if \code{x} is a matrix.  If
    \code{x} is a factor, \code{y} should be a factor of the same length.}

\item{ci}{Confidence Interval (CI) level}

\item{adjust}{Should the effect size be bias-corrected? Defaults to \code{FALSE}.}

\item{CI}{Deprecated in favor of \code{ci}.}

\item{...}{Arguments passed to \code{\link[stats:chisq.test]{stats::chisq.test()}}, such as \code{p}. Ignored
for \code{cohens_g()}.}
}
\value{
A data frame with the effect size(s), and confidence interval(s).

\description{
Compute Cramer's \emph{V}, phi (\eqn{\phi}), Cohen's \emph{w} (an alias of phi) and
Cohen's \emph{g} for contingency tables or goodness-of-fit. See details.
}
\details{
Cramer's \emph{V} and phi (\eqn{\phi}) are effect sizes for tests of independence
in 2D contingency tables, or for goodness-of-fit in 1D tables. For 2x2
tables, all 3 are identical, and are equal to the simple correlation between
two dichotomous variables, ranging between  0 (no dependence) and 1 (perfect
dependence). For larger tables, Cramer's \emph{V} should be used, as it is bounded
between 0-1, whereas phi can be larger than 1.
\cr\cr
Cohen's \emph{g} is an effect size for dependent (paired) contingency tables
ranging between 0 (perfect symmetry) and 0.5 (perfect asymmetry) (see
\code{\link[stats:mcnemar.test]{stats::mcnemar.test()}}).
\subsection{Confidence Intervals}{

For Cramer's \emph{V} and phi, confidence intervals are estimated using the
Noncentrality parameter method; These methods searches for a the best \code{ncp}
(non-central parameters) for of the noncentral Chi-squared distribution for
the desired tail-probabilities, and then convert these \code{ncp}s to the
corresponding effect sizes.
\cr\cr
For Cohen's \emph{g}, confidence intervals are based on the proportion (\eqn{P = g
+ 0.5}) confidence intervals returned by \code{\link[stats:prop.test]{stats::prop.test()}} (minus 0.5),
which give a good close approximation.
