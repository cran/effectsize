\arguments{
\item{model}{A model, ANOVA object, or the result of \code{parameters::model_parameters}.}

\item{partial}{If \code{TRUE}, return partial indices.}

\item{generalized}{If TRUE, returns generalized Eta Squared, assuming all
variables are manipulated. Can also be a character vector of observed
(non-manipulated) variables, in which case generalized Eta Squared is
calculated taking these observed variables into account. For \code{afex_aov}
model, \code{generalized = TRUE}, the observed variables are extracted
automatically from the fitted model, if they were provided then.}

\item{ci}{Confidence Interval (CI) level}

\item{...}{Arguments passed to or from other methods (ignored).}

\item{squared}{Return Cohen's \emph{f} or Cohen's \emph{f}-squared?}

\item{model2}{Second model. If specified, returns Cohen's \emph{f} for
R-squared-change between the two models.}
}
\value{
A data frame with the effect size(s) and confidence interval(s).

A data frame containing the effect size values and their confidence intervals.

\description{
Functions to compute effect size measures for ANOVAs, such as Eta, Omega and
Epsilon squared, and Cohen's f (or their partialled versions) for \code{aov},
\code{aovlist} and \code{anova} models. These indices represent an estimate of how much
variance in the response variables is accounted for by the explanatory
variable(s).
\cr\cr
Effect sizes are computed using the sums of squares obtained from
\code{anova(model)} which might not always be appropriate (\strong{\emph{Yeah... ANOVAs are
hard...}}). It is suggested that ANOVA models be fit with \code{afex} package.
See details.
}
\details{
For \code{aov} and \code{aovlist} models, the effect sizes are computed directly with
Sums-of-Squares (for \code{mlm} / \code{maov} models, effect sizes are computed for
each response separately). For all other model, the model is passed to
\code{anova()}, and effect sizes are approximated via test statistic conversion
(see \code{\link[=F_to_eta2]{F_to_eta2()}} for more details.)
\subsection{Type of Sums of Squares}{

The sums of squares (or F statistics) used for the computation of the effect
sizes is based on those returned by \code{anova(model)} (whatever those may be -
for \code{aov} and \code{aovlist} these are \emph{type-1} sums of squares; for \code{merMod}
these are \emph{type-3} sums of squares). Make sure these are the sums of squares
you are interested in; You might want to pass the result of \code{car::Anova(mode, type = 3)}, or use the \code{afex} package to fit ANOVA models.
\cr\cr
It is generally recommended to fit models with \emph{\code{contr.sum} factor weights}
and \emph{centered covariates}, for sensible results. See examples and the \code{afex}
package.
}

\subsection{Confidence Intervals}{

Confidence intervals are estimated using the Noncentrality parameter method;
These methods searches for a the best \code{ncp} (non-central parameters) for
of the noncentral F distribution for the desired tail-probabilities,
and then convert these \code{ncp}s to the corresponding effect sizes.
\cr\cr
Special care should be taken when interpreting CIs with a lower bound equal
to (or small then) 0, and even more care should be taken when the \emph{upper}
bound is equal to (or small then) 0 (Steiger, 2004; Morey et al., 2016).
}

\subsection{Un-Biased Estimate of Eta}{

Both \emph{\strong{Omega}} and \emph{\strong{Epsilon}} are unbiased estimators of the
population's \emph{\strong{Eta}}, which is especially important is small samples. But
which to choose?
\cr\cr
Though Omega is the more popular choice (Albers \& Lakens, 2018), Epsilon is
analogous to adjusted R2 (Allen, 2017, p. 382), and has been found to be less
biased (Carroll & Nordholm, 1975).
}

\subsection{Cohen's f}{

Cohen's f can take on values between zero, when the population means are all
equal, and an indefinitely large number as standard deviation of means
increases relative to the average standard deviation within each group.
\cr\cr
When comparing two models in a sequential regression analysis, Cohen's f for
R-square change is the ratio between ratio between the increase in R-square
and the \\% unexplained variance.
\cr\cr
Cohen has suggested that the values of 0.10, 0.25, and 0.40 represent small,
medium, and large effect sizes, respectively.
