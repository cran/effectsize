\description{
Functions to compute effect size measures for ANOVAs, such as Eta, Omega and Epsilon squared,
and Cohen's f (or their partialled versions) for \code{aov}, \code{aovlist} and \code{anova}
models. These indices represent an estimate of how much variance in the response variables
is accounted for by the explanatory variable(s).
\cr\cr
Effect sizes are computed using the sums of squares obtained from \code{anova(model)} which
might not always be appropriate (\strong{\emph{Yeah... ANOVAs are hard...}}). See details.
}
\details{
For \code{aov} and \code{aovlist} models, the effect sizes are computed directly with
Sums-of-Squares. For all other model, the model is passed to \code{anova()}, and effect
sizes are approximated via test statistic conversion (see \verb{[F_to_eta2] for more details.})
\subsection{Type of Sums of Squares}{

The sums of squares (or F statistics) used for the computation of the effect sizes is
based on those returned by \code{anova(model)} (whatever those may be - for \code{aov}
and \code{aovlist} these are \emph{type-1} sums of squares; for \code{merMod} these are
\emph{type-3} sums of squares). Make sure these are the sums of squares you are intrested
in (you might want to pass the result of \code{car::Anova(mode, type = 3)}).
\cr\cr
It is generally recommended to fit models with \emph{\code{contr.sum} factor weights} and
\emph{centered covariates}, for sensible results. See examples.
}

\subsection{Confidence Intervals}{

Confidence intervals are estimated using the Noncentrality parameter method;
These methods searches for a the best \code{ncp} (non-central parameters) for
of the noncentral F distribution for the desired tail-probabilities,
and then convert these \code{ncp}s to the corresponding effect sizes.
\cr\cr
Special care should be taken when interpreting CIs with a lower bound equal
to (or small then) 0, and even more care should be taken when the
\emph{upper} bound is equal to (or small then) 0 (Steiger, 2004; Morey et al., 2016).
}

\subsection{Un-Biased Estimate of Eta}{

Both \emph{\strong{Omega}} and \emph{\strong{Epsilon}} are unbiased estimators of the
population's \emph{\strong{Eta}}, which is especially important is small samples. But
which to choose?
\cr\cr
Though Omega is the more popular choice (Albers \& Lakens, 2018), Epsilon is
analogous to adjusted R2 (Allen, 2017, p. 382), and has been found to be less
biased (Carroll & Nordholm, 1975).
}

\subsection{Cohen's f}{

Cohen's f can take on values between zero, when the population
means are all equal, and an indefinitely large number as standard deviation of means
increases relative to the average standard deviation within each group. Cohen has
suggested that the values of 0.10, 0.25, and 0.40 represent small, medium, and large
effect sizes, respectively.
