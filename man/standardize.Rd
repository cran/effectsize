\usage{
standardize(x, ...)

\method{standardize}{data.frame}(
  x,
  robust = FALSE,
  two_sd = FALSE,
  select = NULL,
  exclude = NULL,
  verbose = TRUE,
  force = FALSE,
  append = FALSE,
  suffix = "_z",
  ...
)

\method{standardize}{default}(
  x,
  robust = FALSE,
  two_sd = FALSE,
  include_response = TRUE,
  verbose = TRUE,
  ...
)
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{A data frame, a vector or a statistical model.}

\item{...}{Arguments passed to or from other methods.}

\item{robust}{Logical, if \code{TRUE}, centering is done by subtracting the
median from the variables and dividing it by the median absolute deviation
(MAD). If \code{FALSE}, variables are standardized by subtracting the
mean and dividing it by the standard deviation (SD).}

\item{two_sd}{If \code{TRUE}, the variables are scaled by two times the deviation (SD or MAD depending on \code{robust}). This method can be useful to obtain model coefficients of continuous parameters comparable to coefficients related to binary predictors (Gelman, 2008).}

\item{select}{Character vector of column names. If \code{NULL} (the default), all variables will be selected.}

\item{exclude}{Character vector of column names to be excluded from selection.}

\item{verbose}{Toggle warnings on or off.}

\item{force}{Logical, if \code{TRUE}, forces standardization of factors as
well. Factors are converted to numerical values, with the lowest level
being the value \code{1} (unless the factor has numeric levels, which are
converted to the corresponding numeric value).}

\item{append}{Logical, if \code{TRUE} and \code{x} is a data frame, standardized
variables will be added as additional columns; if \code{FALSE},
existing variables are overwritten.}

\item{suffix}{Character value, will be appended to variable (column) names of
\code{x}, if \code{x} is a data frame and \code{append = TRUE}.}

\item{include_response}{For a model, if \code{TRUE} (default), the response value
will also be standardized. If \code{FALSE}, only the predictors will be standardized.
Note that for certain models (logistic regression, count models, ...), the
response value will never be standardized, to make re-fitting the model work.}
}
\value{
The standardized object (either a standardize data frame or a statistical model fitted on standardized data).
}
\description{
Performs a standardization of data (z-scoring), i.e., centering and scaling, so that the data is expressed in terms of standard deviation (i.e., mean = 0, SD = 1) or Median Absolute Deviance (median = 0, MAD = 1). When applied to a statistical model, this function extracts the dataset, standardizes it, and refits the model with this standardized version of the dataset. The \code{\link[=normalize]{normalize()}} function can also be used to scale all numeric variables within the 0 - 1 range.
}
\details{
If \code{x} is a model object, standardization is done by completely refitting the model on the standardized data. Hence, this approach is equal to standardizing the variables before fitting the model and will return a new model object. However, this method is particularly recommended for complex models that include interactions or transformations (e.g., polynomial or spline terms). The \code{robust} (default to \code{FALSE}) argument enables a robust standardization of data, i.e., based on the \code{median} and \code{MAD} instead of the \code{mean} and \code{SD}. See \code{\link[=standardize_parameters]{standardize_parameters()}} for other methods of standardizing model coefficients.
}
\note{
When \code{x} is a data frame or vector, missing values are preserved, so the return value has the same length / number of rows as the original input.
